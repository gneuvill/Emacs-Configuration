  <p class="simpara">
   The Zend API has evolved considerably over time, as PHP has become a more
   robust and widespread language. With the introduction of PHP 5 came the
   Zend Engine 2 (ZE2). ZE2 came with an almost entirely new Object-Oriented
    Programming (OOP) model, as well as improvements in most aspects of the
   API. PHP 6, which is still under active development at the time of this
   writing, introduces the Zend Engine 3 (ZE3), which brings full Unicode
   support to the language.

    This documentation is still under heavy development. The original Zend
    documentation is preserved in its entirety in the
    <a href="internals2.ze1.html" class="link">Zend Engine 1</a> section for those who
    need it before this documentation is completed.

   This section of the manual is devoted to ZE2. While PHP 4.4 is still in
   widespread use, the differences in how extensions are written in ZE1 are
   small; a short reference to them is given in an appendix to this section.
   ZE3&#039;s API may yet change significantly, and is covered in another appendix.
   It will be more fully documented when PHP 6 enters a beta testing stage.
  </p>
   
  <p class="simpara">
   The documentation in this section is current as of PHP 5.2.5, the most
   recent stable release at the time of this writing. Notable differences in
   the minor PHP 5 releases (5.0 through 5.3) are given as appropriate.
