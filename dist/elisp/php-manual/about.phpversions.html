  <h2 class="title">PHP versions documented in this manual</h2>
  <p class="para">
   The manual contains information about past, current, and future versions
   of PHP. Changes in behaviour are documented as notes, changelogs, and 
   inline text within the manual pages. 
   The earliest documented version is PHP 4.1.0, 
   whereas the latest is PHP 6.x.x.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Documentation partly exists for the CVS version of PHP, which
   always means the very latest development version. This has yet to
   be released so is only available through the CVS version handling system, 
   or via a <a href="http://snaps.php.net/" class="link external">&raquo; snapshot</a>. So be aware that
   features marked &quot;available in CVS&quot; are typically unavailable. These 
   features, though, will most likely be available in the next stable version 
   of PHP. To download the CVS version, see the <a href="http://www.php.net/anoncvs.php" class="link external">&raquo; anonymous
   CVS access page</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   So, documentation may exist for PHP versions that aren&#039;t yet released.
   (Something like PHP 6.x.x while the latest stable version might be 
   5.x.x). Most of the time, this is not an error in the documentation.
   Explanation is often added for features not available in the current
   PHP release, but will be available as a known future PHP version.
   Typically, PHP only adds new features in major releases otherwise only bugs
   are fixed. Using the A.B.C versioning format, a major release increments A 
   or B whereas minor releases increment C. So for example it&#039;s not uncommon 
   for a feature to be documented as available in PHP x.1.x when the latest 
   release is PHP x.0.x. Also note that the manual is written in present 
   tense, not future tense.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Many times the PHP manual lists &quot;Default Values&quot; for PHP directives. These 
   values are based on <var class="filename">php.ini-dist</var> and not 
   <var class="filename">php.ini-recommended</var>. They also refer to the latest  
   version of PHP. See the <a href="ini.list.html" class="link">PHP directive 
   appendix</a> for details on these values and changes.
