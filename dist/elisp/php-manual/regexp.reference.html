      The syntax and semantics of  the  regular  expressions
      supported  by PCRE are described below. Regular expressions are
      also described in the Perl documentation and in a number  of
      other  books,  some  of which have copious examples. Jeffrey
      Friedl&#039;s  &quot;Mastering  Regular  Expressions&quot;,  published   by
      O&#039;Reilly  (ISBN 1-56592-257-3), covers them in great detail.
      The description here is intended as reference documentation.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against  a
      subject string from left to right. Most characters stand for
      themselves in a pattern, and match the corresponding
      characters in the subject. As a trivial example, the pattern
      <i>The quick brown fox</i>
      matches a portion of a subject string that is  identical  to
      itself.

     <h2 class="title">Meta-characters</h2>
     <p class="para">     
      The  power  of  regular  expressions comes from the
      ability to include alternatives and repetitions in the
      pattern.  These  are encoded in the pattern by the use of 
      <em class="emphasis">meta-characters</em>, which do not stand for  themselves  but  instead
      are interpreted in some special way.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      There are two different sets of meta-characters: those  that
      are  recognized anywhere in the pattern except within square
      brackets, and those that are recognized in square brackets.
      Outside square brackets, the meta-characters are as follows:

      The following sections describe the use of each of the
      meta-characters.
     </p>
    </div>

    <div id="regexp.reference.backslash" class="section">
     <h2 class="title">Backslash</h2>
     <p class="para">
      The backslash character has several uses. Firstly, if it  is
      followed by a non-alphanumeric character, it takes away any
      special  meaning that character may have. This use of
      backslash as an escape character applies both inside and
      outside character classes.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      For example, if you want to match a &quot;*&quot; character, you write
      &quot;\*&quot; in the pattern. This applies whether or not the
      following character would otherwise be interpreted as a
      meta-character, so it is always safe to precede a non-alphanumeric
      with &quot;\&quot; to specify that it stands for itself.  In
      particular, if you want to match a backslash, you write &quot;\\&quot;.
     </p>
     <blockquote><p><b class="note">Note</b>: 
      
       Single and double quoted PHP <a href="language.types.string.html#language.types.string.syntax" class="link">strings</a> have special
       meaning of backslash. Thus if \ has to be matched with a regular
       expression \\, then &quot;\\\\&quot; or &#039;\\\\&#039; must be used in PHP code.
      <br />
     </p></blockquote>
     <p class="para">
      If a pattern is compiled with the
      <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_EXTENDED</a> option,
      whitespace in the pattern (other than in a character class) and
      characters between a &quot;#&quot; outside a character class and the next newline
      character are ignored. An escaping backslash can be used to include a
      whitespace or &quot;#&quot; character as part of the pattern.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      A second use of backslash provides a way of encoding
      non-printing characters in patterns in a visible manner. There
      is no restriction on the appearance of non-printing  characters,
      apart from the binary zero that terminates a pattern,
      but when a pattern is being prepared by text editing, it is
      usually  easier to use one of the following escape sequences
      than the binary character it represents:

    <p class="para">
     The precise effect of &quot;<i>\cx</i>&quot; is as follows: 
     if &quot;<i>x</i>&quot; is a lower case  letter, it is converted
     to upper case. Then bit 6 of the character (hex 40) is inverted. 
     Thus &quot;<i>\cz</i>&quot; becomes  hex 1A, but
     &quot;<i>\c{</i>&quot; becomes hex 3B, while &quot;<i>\c;</i>&quot;
     becomes hex 7B.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     After &quot;<i>\x</i>&quot;, up to two hexadecimal digits are
     read (letters can be in upper or lower case).
     In <em class="emphasis">UTF-8 mode</em>, &quot;<i>\x{...}</i>&quot; is
     allowed, where the contents of the braces is a string of hexadecimal
     digits. It is interpreted as a UTF-8 character whose code number is the
     given hexadecimal number. The original hexadecimal escape sequence,
     <i>\xhh</i>, matches a two-byte UTF-8 character if the value
     is greater than 127.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     After &quot;<i>\0</i>&quot; up to two further octal digits are read.
     In  both cases,  if  there are fewer than two digits, just those that
     are present are used. Thus the sequence &quot;<i>\0\x\07</i>&quot; 
     specifies two binary zeros followed by a BEL character. Make sure you
     supply two digits after the initial zero if the character
     that follows is itself an octal digit.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     The handling of a backslash followed by a digit other than 0
     is complicated. Outside a character class, PCRE reads it
     and any following digits as a decimal number. If the  number
     is  less  than  10, or if there have been at least that many
     previous capturing left parentheses in the  expression,  the
     entire  sequence is taken as a <em class="emphasis">back</em> 
     <em class="emphasis">reference</em>. A description
     of how this works is given later, following  the  discussion
     of parenthesized subpatterns.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Inside a character  class,  or  if  the  decimal  number  is
     greater than 9 and there have not been that many capturing
     subpatterns, PCRE re-reads up to three octal digits following 
     the backslash, and generates a single byte from the
     least significant 8 bits of the value. Any subsequent digits
     stand for themselves.  For example:

      circumflex  character  is an assertion which is true only if
      the current matching point is at the start  of  the  subject
      string. Inside a character class, circumflex has an entirely
      different meaning (see below).
     </p>

      Circumflex need not be the first character of the pattern if
      a number of alternatives are involved, but it should be the

      pattern is ever to match that branch. If all possible
      alternatives start with a circumflex, that is, if the pattern is
      constrained to match only at the start of the subject, it is
      said to be an &quot;anchored&quot; pattern. (There are also other
      constructs that can cause a pattern to be anchored.)

     <p class="para">
      A dollar character is an assertion which is <b><tt class="constant">TRUE</tt></b> only if the
      current  matching point is at the end of the subject string,
      or immediately before a newline character that is  the  last
      character in the string (by default). Dollar need not be the
      last character of the pattern if a  number  of  alternatives
      are  involved,  but it should be the last item in any branch
      in which it appears.  Dollar has no  special  meaning  in  a
      character class.

     <p class="para">
      The meaning of dollar can be changed so that it matches only
      at the very end of the string, by setting the
      <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY</a>
      option at compile or matching time. This does not affect the \Z assertion.

      is set. When this is the case, they match immediately after and
      immediately before an internal &quot;\n&quot; character, respectively, in addition
      to matching at the start and end of the subject string. For example, the
      pattern /^abc$/ matches the subject string &quot;def\nabc&quot; in multiline mode,
      but not otherwise. Consequently, patterns that are anchored in single
      line mode because all branches start with &quot;^&quot; are not anchored in

      bracket  is  required as a member of the class, it should be

     <p class="para">
      A character class matches a single character in the subject;
      the  character  must  be in the set of characters defined by

      first character, or escape it with a backslash.

      For example, the character class [aeiou] matches  any  lower
      case vowel, while [^aeiou] matches any character that is not
      a lower case vowel. Note that a circumflex is  just  a
      convenient  notation for specifying the characters which are in
      the class by enumerating those that are not. It  is  not  an
      assertion:  it  still  consumes a character from the subject
      string, and fails if the current pointer is at  the  end  of
      the string.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      When case-insensitive (caseless) matching is set, any letters
      in a class represent both their upper case and lower case
      versions, so for example, an insensitive [aeiou] matches &quot;A&quot;

      &quot;A&quot;, whereas a sensitive (caseful) version would.

      or <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_MULTILINE</a>

      The minus (hyphen) character can be used to specify a  range
      of  characters  in  a  character  class.  For example, [d-m]
      matches any letter between d and m, inclusive.  If  a  minus
      character  is required in a class, it must be escaped with a
      backslash or appear in a position where it cannot be
      interpreted as indicating a range, typically as the first or last
      character in the class.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      It is not possible to have the literal character &quot;]&quot; as  the
      end  character  of  a  range.  A  pattern such as [W-]46] is
      interpreted as a class of two characters (&quot;W&quot; and &quot;-&quot;)
      followed by a literal string &quot;46]&quot;, so it would match &quot;W46]&quot; or
      &quot;-46]&quot;. However, if the &quot;]&quot; is escaped with a  backslash  it
      is  interpreted  as  the end of range, so [W-\]46] is
      interpreted as a single class containing a range followed by  two
      separate characters. The octal or hexadecimal representation
      of &quot;]&quot; can also be used to end a range.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      Ranges operate in ASCII collating sequence. They can also be
      used  for  characters  specified  numerically,  for  example
      [\000-\037]. If a range that includes letters is  used  when
      case-insensitive (caseless)  matching  is set, it matches the
      letters in either case. For example, [W-c] is equivalent  to
      [][\^_`wxyzabc], matched case-insensitively, and if character
      tables for the &quot;fr&quot; locale are in use, [\xc8-\xcb] matches
      accented E characters in both cases.

     <p class="para">
      The character types \d, \D, \s, \S,  \w,  and  \W  may  also
      appear  in  a  character  class, and add the characters that
      they match to the class. For example, [\dABCDEF] matches any
      hexadecimal  digit.  A  circumflex  can conveniently be used
      with the upper case character types to specify a  more
      restricted set of characters than the matching lower case type.
      For example, the class [^\W_] matches any letter  or  digit,
      but not underscore.

      All non-alphanumeric characters other than \,  -,  ^  (at  the

      For example, (?im) sets case-insensitive (caseless), multiline matching. It  is
      also possible to unset these options by preceding the letter
      with a hyphen, and a combined setting and unsetting such  as
      (?im-sx),  which sets <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_CASELESS</a> and

     <p class="para">
      When an option change occurs at top level (that is, not inside
      subpattern parentheses), the change applies to the remainder of the
      pattern that follows. So <i>/ab(?i)c/</i> matches only &quot;abc&quot;
      and &quot;abC&quot;. This behaviour has been changed in PCRE 4.0, which is bundled
      since PHP 4.3.3. Before those versions, <i>/ab(?i)c/</i> would
      perform as <i>/abc/i</i> (e.g. matching &quot;ABC&quot; and &quot;aBc&quot;).
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      If an option change occurs inside a subpattern,  the  effect
      is  different.  This is a change of behaviour in Perl 5.005.
      An option change inside a subpattern affects only that  part
      of the subpattern that follows it, so

        <i>(a(?i)b)c</i>

      matches  abc  and  aBc  and  no  other   strings   (assuming <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_CASELESS</a> is not
      used). By this means, options can be made to have different settings in
      different parts of the pattern. Any changes made in one alternative do
      carry on into subsequent branches within the same subpattern. For
      example,

        <i>(a(?i)b|c)</i>

      matches &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;aB&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;, even though when  matching
      &quot;C&quot; the first branch is abandoned before the option setting.
      This is because the effects of  option  settings  happen  at
      compile  time. There would be some very weird behaviour otherwise.

      be changed in the same way as the Perl-compatible options by
      using the characters U and X  respectively.  The  (?X)  flag
      setting  is  special in that it must always occur earlier in
      the pattern than any of the additional features it turns on,
      even when it is at top level. It is best put at the start.

    <div id="regexp.reference.subpatterns" class="section">
     <h2 class="title">Subpatterns</h2>
     <p class="para">
     Subpatterns are delimited by parentheses  (round  brackets),
     which can be nested.  Marking part of a pattern as a subpattern
     does two things:
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     1. It localizes a set of alternatives. For example, the
     pattern

       <i>cat(aract|erpillar|)</i>

     matches one of the words &quot;cat&quot;,  &quot;cataract&quot;,  or  &quot;caterpillar&quot;.
     Without  the  parentheses, it would match &quot;cataract&quot;,
     &quot;erpillar&quot; or the empty string.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     2. It sets up the subpattern as a capturing  subpattern  (as
     defined  above).   When the whole pattern matches, that portion
     of the subject string that matched  the  subpattern  is
     passed  back  to  the  caller  via  the  <em class="emphasis">ovector</em>
     argument of
     <b>pcre_exec()</b>. Opening parentheses are counted
     from  left  to right (starting from 1) to obtain the numbers of the
     capturing subpatterns.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     For example, if the string &quot;the red king&quot; is matched against
     the pattern

       <i>the ((red|white) (king|queen))</i>

     the captured substrings are &quot;red king&quot;, &quot;red&quot;,  and  &quot;king&quot;,
     and are numbered 1, 2, and 3.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     The fact that plain parentheses fulfill two functions is  not
     always  helpful.  There are often times when a grouping subpattern
     is required without a capturing requirement.  If  an
     opening parenthesis is followed by &quot;?:&quot;, the subpattern does
     not do any capturing, and is not counted when computing  the
     number of any subsequent capturing subpatterns. For example,
     if the string &quot;the  white  queen&quot;  is  matched  against  the
     pattern

       <i>the ((?:red|white) (king|queen))</i>

     the captured substrings are &quot;white queen&quot; and  &quot;queen&quot;,  and
     are  numbered  1  and 2. The maximum number of captured substrings
     is 99, and the maximum number  of  all  subpatterns,
     both capturing and non-capturing, is 200.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     As a  convenient  shorthand,  if  any  option  settings  are
     required  at  the  start  of a non-capturing subpattern, the
     option letters may appear between the &quot;?&quot; and the &quot;:&quot;.  Thus
     the two patterns

       (?i:saturday|sunday)
       (?:(?i)saturday|sunday)
    </pre>

    <p class="para">
     match exactly the same set of strings.  Because  alternative
     branches  are  tried from left to right, and options are not
     reset until the end of the subpattern is reached, an  option
     setting  in  one  branch does affect subsequent branches, so
     the above patterns match &quot;SUNDAY&quot; as well as &quot;Saturday&quot;.

     <p class="para">
      It is possible to name the subpattern with
      <i>(?P&lt;name&gt;pattern)</i> since PHP 4.3.3. Array with

    <p class="para">
     The general repetition quantifier specifies  a  minimum  and
     maximum  number  of  permitted  matches,  by  giving the two
     numbers in curly brackets (braces), separated  by  a  comma.
     The  numbers  must be less than 65536, and the first must be
     less than or equal to the second. For example:

       <i>z{2,4}</i>

     matches &quot;zz&quot;, &quot;zzz&quot;, or &quot;zzzz&quot;. A closing brace on  its  own
     is not a special character. If the second number is omitted,
     but the comma is present, there is no upper  limit;  if  the
     second number and the comma are both omitted, the quantifier
     specifies an exact number of required matches. Thus

       <i>[aeiou]{3,}</i>

     matches at least 3 successive vowels,  but  may  match  many
     more, while

       <i>\d{8}</i>

     matches exactly 8 digits.  An  opening  curly  bracket  that
     appears  in a position where a quantifier is not allowed, or
     one that does not match the syntax of a quantifier, is taken
     as  a literal character. For example, {,6} is not a quantifier,
     but a literal string of four characters.

     It is possible to construct infinite loops  by  following  a

    <p class="para">
     Earlier versions of Perl and PCRE used to give an  error  at
     compile  time  for such patterns. However, because there are
     cases where this  can  be  useful,  such  patterns  are  now
     accepted,  but  if  any repetition of the subpattern does in
     fact match no characters, the loop is forcibly broken.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     By default, the quantifiers  are  &quot;greedy&quot;,  that  is,  they
     match  as much as possible (up to the maximum number of permitted
     times), without causing the rest of  the  pattern  to
     fail. The classic example of where this gives problems is in
     trying to match comments in C programs. These appear between
     the  sequences /* and */ and within the sequence, individual
     * and / characters may appear. An attempt to  match  C  comments
     by applying the pattern

       <i>/\*.*\*/</i>

     to the string

       <i>/* first comment */  not comment  /* second comment */</i>

     fails, because it matches  the  entire  string  due  to  the
     greediness of the .*  item.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     However, if a quantifier is followed  by  a  question  mark,
     then it ceases to be greedy, and instead matches the minimum
     number of times possible, so the pattern

       <i>/\*.*?\*/</i>

     does the right thing with the C comments. The meaning of the
     various  quantifiers is not otherwise changed, just the preferred
     number of matches.  Do not confuse this use of
     question  mark  with  its  use as a quantifier in its own right.
     Because it has two uses, it can sometimes appear doubled, as
     in

       <i>\d??\d</i>

     which matches one digit by preference, but can match two  if
     that is the only way the rest of the pattern matches.

     them  with  a  question mark. In other words, it inverts the
     default behaviour.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Quantifiers followed by <i>+</i> are &quot;possessive&quot;. They eat
     as many characters as possible and don&#039;t return to match the rest of the

     <i>.*+abc</i> doesn&#039;t because <i>.*+</i> eats the

     When a parenthesized subpattern is quantified with a minimum

     to match newlines, then the pattern is implicitly  anchored,
     because whatever follows will be tried against every character
     position in the subject string, so there is no point  in
     retrying  the overall match at any position after the first.
     PCRE treats such a pattern as though it were preceded by \A.
     In  cases where it is known that the subject string contains
     no newlines, it is worth setting <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_DOTALL</a>  when  the

     When a capturing subpattern is repeated, the value  captured
     is the substring that matched the final iteration. For example, after

     has matched &quot;tweedledum tweedledee&quot; the value  of  the  captured
     substring  is  &quot;tweedledee&quot;.  However,  if  there are
     nested capturing  subpatterns,  the  corresponding  captured
     values  may  have been set in previous iterations. For example,
     after
     
       <i>/(a|(b))+/</i>

     matches &quot;aba&quot; the value of the second captured substring  is
     &quot;b&quot;.

     Outside a character class, a backslash followed by  a  digit
     greater  than  0  (and  possibly  further  digits) is a back
     reference to a capturing subpattern  earlier  (i.e.  to  its
     left)  in  the  pattern,  provided there have been that many
     previous capturing left parentheses.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     However, if the decimal number following  the  backslash  is
     less  than  10,  it is always taken as a back reference, and
     causes an error only if there are not  that  many  capturing
     left  parentheses in the entire pattern. In other words, the
     parentheses that are referenced need not be to the  left  of
     the  reference  for  numbers  less  than 10. See the section
     entitled &quot;Backslash&quot; above for further details of  the  handling
     of digits following a backslash.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     A back reference matches whatever actually matched the  capturing
     subpattern in the current subject string, rather than
     anything matching the subpattern itself. So the pattern

       <i>(sens|respons)e and \1ibility</i>

     matches &quot;sense and sensibility&quot; and &quot;response and  responsibility&quot;,
     but  not  &quot;sense  and  responsibility&quot;. If case-sensitive (caseful)
     matching is in force at the time of the back reference, then
     the case of letters is relevant. For example,

       <i>((?i)rah)\s+\1</i>

     matches &quot;rah rah&quot; and &quot;RAH RAH&quot;, but  not  &quot;RAH  rah&quot;,  even
     though  the  original  capturing subpattern is matched
     case-insensitively (caselessly).
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     There may be more than one back reference to the  same  subpattern.
     If  a  subpattern  has not actually been used in a
     particular match, then any  back  references  to  it  always
     fail. For example, the pattern

       <i>(a|(bc))\2</i>

     always fails if it starts to match  &quot;a&quot;  rather  than  &quot;bc&quot;.
     Because  there  may  be up to 99 back references, all digits
     following the backslash are taken as  part  of  a  potential
     back reference number. If the pattern continues with a digit
     character, then some delimiter must be used to terminate the
     back reference. If the <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_EXTENDED</a>  option

     A back reference that occurs inside the parentheses to which
     it  refers  fails when the subpattern is first used, so, for

       <i>(a|b\1)+</i>

     matches any number of &quot;a&quot;s and also &quot;aba&quot;, &quot;ababaa&quot; etc.  At
     each iteration of the subpattern, the back reference matches
     the character string corresponding to  the  previous  iteration.
     In order for this to work, the pattern must be such
     that the first iteration does not need  to  match  the  back
     reference.  This  can  be  done using alternation, as in the
     example above, or by a quantifier with a minimum of zero.

     <h2 class="title">Assertions</h2>
     <p class="para">
     An assertion is  a  test  on  the  characters  following  or
     preceding  the current matching point that does not actually
     consume any characters. The simple assertions coded  as  \b,
     \B,  \A,  \Z,  \z, ^ and $ are described above. More complicated
     assertions are coded as  subpatterns.  There  are  two
     kinds:  those that look ahead of the current position in the
     subject string, and those that look behind it.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     An assertion subpattern is matched in the normal way, except
     that  it  does not cause the current matching position to be
     changed. Lookahead assertions start with  (?=  for  positive
     assertions and (?! for negative assertions. For example,

       <i>\w+(?=;)</i>

     matches a word followed by a semicolon, but does not include
     the semicolon in the match, and

       <i>foo(?!bar)</i>

     matches any occurrence of &quot;foo&quot;  that  is  not  followed  by
     &quot;bar&quot;. Note that the apparently similar pattern

       <i>(?!foo)bar</i>

     does not find an occurrence of &quot;bar&quot;  that  is  preceded  by
     something other than &quot;foo&quot;; it finds any occurrence of &quot;bar&quot;
     whatsoever, because the assertion  (?!foo)  is  always  <b><tt class="constant">TRUE</tt></b>
     when  the  next  three  characters  are  &quot;bar&quot;. A lookbehind
     assertion is needed to achieve this effect.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Lookbehind assertions start with (?&lt;=  for  positive  assertions
     and (?&lt;! for negative assertions. For example,

       <i>(?&lt;!foo)bar</i>

     does find an occurrence of &quot;bar&quot; that  is  not  preceded  by
     &quot;foo&quot;. The contents of a lookbehind assertion are restricted
     such that all the strings  it  matches  must  have  a  fixed
     length.  However, if there are several alternatives, they do
     not all have to have the same fixed length. Thus

       <i>(?&lt;=bullock|donkey)</i>

     is permitted, but

       <i>(?&lt;!dogs?|cats?)</i>

     causes an error at compile time. Branches  that  match  different
     length strings are permitted only at the top level of
     a lookbehind assertion. This is an extension  compared  with
     Perl  5.005,  which  requires all branches to match the same
     length of string. An assertion such as

       <i>(?&lt;=ab(c|de))</i>

     is not permitted, because its single  top-level  branch  can
     match two different lengths, but it is acceptable if rewritten
     to use two top-level branches:

       <i>(?&lt;=abc|abde)</i>

     The implementation of lookbehind  assertions  is,  for  each
     alternative,  to  temporarily move the current position back
     by the fixed width and then  try  to  match.  If  there  are
     insufficient  characters  before  the  current position, the
     match is deemed to fail.  Lookbehinds  in  conjunction  with
     once-only  subpatterns can be particularly useful for matching
     at the ends of strings; an example is given at  the  end
     of the section on once-only subpatterns.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Several assertions (of any sort) may  occur  in  succession.
     For example,

       <i>(?&lt;=\d{3})(?&lt;!999)foo</i>

     matches &quot;foo&quot; preceded by three digits that are  not  &quot;999&quot;.
     Notice  that each of the assertions is applied independently
     at the same point in the subject string. First  there  is  a
     check  that  the  previous  three characters are all digits,
     then there is a check that the same three characters are not
     &quot;999&quot;.   This  pattern  does not match &quot;foo&quot; preceded by six
     characters, the first of which are digits and the last three
     of  which  are  not  &quot;999&quot;.  For  example,  it doesn&#039;t match
     &quot;123abcfoo&quot;. A pattern to do that is

       <i>(?&lt;=\d{3}...)(?&lt;!999)foo</i>
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     This time the first assertion looks  at  the  preceding  six
     characters,  checking  that  the first three are digits, and
     then the second assertion checks that  the  preceding  three
     characters are not &quot;999&quot;.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Assertions can be nested in any combination. For example,

       <i>(?&lt;=(?&lt;!foo)bar)baz</i>

     prevent this, either to change the nature of the  match,  or

     After matching all 6 digits and then failing to match &quot;foo&quot;,

     means for specifying that once a portion of the pattern  has

     Once-only subpatterns can be used in conjunction with
     look-behind  assertions  to specify efficient matching at the end
     of the subject string. Consider a simple pattern such as

       <i>abcd$</i>

     when applied to a long string which does not match.  Because
     matching  proceeds  from  left  to right, PCRE will look for
     each &quot;a&quot; in the subject and then see if what follows matches
     the rest of the pattern. If the pattern is specified as

       <i>^.*abcd$</i>

     then the initial .* matches the entire string at first,  but
     when  this  fails  (because  there  is no following &quot;a&quot;), it
     backtracks to match all but the last character, then all but
     the  last  two  characters, and so on. Once again the search
     for &quot;a&quot; covers the entire string, from right to left, so  we
     are no better off. However, if the pattern is written as

       <i>^(?&gt;.*)(?&lt;=abcd)</i>

     then there can be no backtracking for the .*  item;  it  can
     match  only  the  entire  string.  The subsequent lookbehind
     assertion does a single test on the last four characters. If
     it  fails,  the  match  fails immediately. For long strings,
     this approach makes a significant difference to the processing time.

     When a pattern contains an unlimited repeat inside a subpattern
     that can itself be repeated an unlimited number of

     avoid  some  failing matches taking a very long time indeed.
     The pattern

       <i>(\D+|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]</i>

     matches an unlimited number of substrings that  either  consist
     of  non-digits,  or digits enclosed in &lt;&gt;, followed by
     either ! or ?. When it matches, it runs quickly. However, if
     it is applied to

       <i>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</i>

     it takes a long  time  before  reporting  failure.  This  is
     because the string can be divided between the two repeats in
     a large number of ways, and all have to be tried. (The example
     used  [!?]  rather  than a single character at the end,
     because both PCRE and Perl have an optimization that  allows
     for  fast  failure  when  a  single  character is used. They
     remember the last single character that is  required  for  a
     match,  and  fail early if it is not present in the string.)
     If the pattern is changed to

       <i>((?&gt;\D+)|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]</i>

     sequences of non-digits cannot be broken, and  failure  happens quickly.

     Consider the problem of matching a  string  in  parentheses,
     allowing  for  unlimited nested parentheses. Without the use
     of recursion, the best that can be done is to use a  pattern
     that  matches  up  to some fixed depth of nesting. It is not
     possible to handle an arbitrary nesting depth. Perl 5.6  has
     provided   an  experimental  facility  that  allows  regular
     expressions to recurse (among other things).  The  special 
     item (?R) is  provided for  the specific  case of recursion. 
     This PCRE  pattern  solves the  parentheses  problem (assume 
     the <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_EXTENDED</a>

     number  of substrings which can either be a sequence of

     a closing parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     This particular example pattern  contains  nested  unlimited
     repeats, and so the use of a once-only subpattern for matching
     strings of non-parentheses is  important  when  applying
     the  pattern to strings that do not match. For example, when
     it is applied to

       <i>(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa()</i>

     it yields &quot;no match&quot; quickly. However, if a  once-only  subpattern
     is  not  used,  the match runs for a very long time
     indeed because there are so many different ways the + and  *
     repeats  can carve up the subject, and all have to be tested
     before failure can be reported.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     The values set for any capturing subpatterns are those  from
     the outermost level of the recursion at which the subpattern
     value is set. If the pattern above is matched against

       <i>(ab(cd)ef)</i>

     the value for the capturing parentheses is  &quot;ef&quot;,  which  is
     the  last  value  taken  on  at the top level. If additional
     parentheses are added, giving

       <i>\( ( ( (?&gt;[^()]+) | (?R) )* ) \)</i>
     then the string they capture
     is &quot;ab(cd)ef&quot;, the contents of the top level parentheses. If
     there are more than 15 capturing parentheses in  a  pattern,
     PCRE  has  to  obtain  extra  memory  to store data during a
     recursion, which it does by using  pcre_malloc,  freeing  it
     via  pcre_free  afterwards. If no memory can be obtained, it
     saves data for the first 15 capturing parentheses  only,  as
     there is no way to give an out-of-memory error from within a
     recursion.

      If the syntax for a recursive subpattern reference (either by number or

      <i>(sens|respons)e and \1ibility</i>
      matches &quot;sense and sensibility&quot; and &quot;response and responsibility&quot;, but
      not &quot;sense and responsibility&quot;. If instead the pattern
      <i>(sens|respons)e and (?1)ibility</i>
      is used, it does match &quot;sense and responsibility&quot; as well as the other
      two strings. Such references must, however, follow the subpattern to

      The maximum length of a subject string is the largest positive number

     When a pattern begins with .* and the <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_DOTALL</a>  option  is

     can match only at the start of a subject string. However, if
     <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_DOTALL</a>

     because the . metacharacter does not then match  a  newline,
     and if the subject string contains newlines, the pattern may
     match from the character immediately following one  of  them
     instead of from the very start. For example, the pattern

       <i>(.*) second</i>

     matches the subject &quot;first\nand second&quot; (where \n stands for
     a newline character) with the first captured substring being
     &quot;and&quot;. In order to do this, PCRE  has  to  retry  the  match

     those  cases other than 0, the + repeats can match different
     numbers of times.) When the remainder of the pattern is such

     An optimization catches some of the more simple  cases  such

     later in the subject string, and if there is not,  it  fails
     the  match  immediately. However, when there is no following
     literal this optimization cannot be used. You  can  see  the
     difference by comparing the behaviour of
