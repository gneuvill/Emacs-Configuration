     <p class="para">
      Of course! There are many mailing lists for several subjects.
      A whole list of mailing lists can be found on our
      <a href="http://www.php.net/support.php" class="link external">&raquo; Support</a> page.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      The most general mailing list is <i>php-general</i>.
      To subscribe, send mail to
      <a href="mailto:php-general-subscribe@lists.php.net" class="link external">&raquo; php-general-subscribe@lists.php.net</a>. 
      You don&#039;t need to include anything special in the subject or body of the message.
      To unsubscribe, send mail to <a href="mailto:php-general-unsubscribe@lists.php.net" class="link external">&raquo; php-general-unsubscribe@lists.php.net</a>.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      You can also subscribe and unsubscribe using the web

      There are countless of them around the world. We
      have links for example to some IRC servers and
      foreign language mailing lists on our <a href="http://www.php.net/support.php" class="link external">&raquo; Support</a> page.

     <p class="para">
      If you have problems subscribing to or unsubscribing from the
      php-general mailing list, it may be because the mailing list software
      can&#039;t figure out the correct mailing address to use. If
      your email address was <i>joeblow@example.com</i>,
      you can send your subscription request to
      <i>php-general-subscribe-joeblow=example.com@lists.php.net</i>,
      or your unsubscription request to
      <i>php-general-unsubscribe-joeblow=example.com@lists.php.net</i>.
      Use similar addresses for the other mailing lists.

       Yes, you will find a list of archive sites on the 
       <a href="http://www.php.net/support.php" class="link external">&raquo; Support</a> page.
       The mailing list articles are also archived as news
       messages. You can access the news server at <a href="news://news.php.net/" class="link external">&raquo; news://news.php.net/</a>
       with a news client. There is also an experimental web
       interface for the news server at <a href="http://news.php.net/" class="link external">&raquo; http://news.php.net/</a>

     <p class="para">
      Since PHP is growing more and more popular by the day the traffic 
      has increased on the php-general mailing list and as of now the
      list gets about 150 to 200 posts a day. Because of this it is
      in everyone&#039;s interest that you use the list as a last resort
      when you have looked everywhere else.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      Before you post to the list please have a look in this FAQ and the 
      manual to see if you can find the help there. If there is nothing 
      to be found there try out the mailing list archives (see above). 
      If you&#039;re having problem with installing or configuring PHP please
      read through all included documentation and README&#039;s. If you still
      can&#039;t find any information that helps you out you&#039;re more than 
      welcome to use the mailing list.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      Before asking questions, you may want to read the paper on 
      <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="link external">&raquo; How To Ask Questions The Smart
      Way</a> as this is a good idea for everyone.

     <p class="para">What information should I include when posting to the mailing list?</p>
    </strong></dt>
    <dd><a name="faq.mailinglist.guideline"></a>
     <p class="para">
      Posts like &quot;I can&#039;t get PHP up and running! Help me! What is
      wrong?&quot; are of absolutely no use to anyone. If you&#039;re having problems
      getting PHP up and running you must include what operating system
      you are running on, what version of PHP you&#039;re trying to set up,
      how you got it (pre-compiled, CVS, RPMs and so on), what you have
      done so far, where you got stuck and the exact error message.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      This goes for any other problem as well. You have to include
      information on what you have done, where you got stuck, what
      you&#039;re trying to do and, if applicable, exact error messages. If
      you&#039;re having problems with your source code you need to include
      the part of the code that isn&#039;t working. Do not include more code
      than necessary though!  It makes the post hard to read and a lot of
      people might just skip it all together because of this. If you&#039;re
      unsure about how much information to include in the mail it&#039;s better
      that you include to much than to little.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      Another important thing to remember is to summarize your problem
      on the subject line. A subject like &quot;HELP MEEEE!!!&quot; or &quot;What is the
      problem here?&quot; will be ignored by the majority of the readers.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      And lastly, you&#039;re encouraged to read the paper on
      <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="link external">&raquo; How To Ask Questions The 
      Smart Way</a> as this will be a great help for everyone, 
      especially yourself.
